Many, and I mean most of my Academic work was critical of Religion, specifically Islam. 
To clarify, my religion is Islam, and much of my work reflects my frustration towards my religion and the Islamist Leaders of Bangladesh. 
I spent much of my undergrad in the pandemic, so much of my work also reflected that.
